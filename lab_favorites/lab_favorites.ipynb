Because Karle is an extrovert, she invites **many** people to her parties. For the upcoming game against Purdue this Saturday (Go Illini!🟠🔵), she needs to mix \"mocktails\" in gallons for all of her guests.  In this part of the lab, you will write a simulation to help simulate the possible drinks available at Karle's tailgate.\n",
